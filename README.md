Given a grayscale photograph as input, this paper attacks the problem of hallucinating a plausible color version of the photograph. The system is implemented as a feed-forward pass in a CNN at test time and is trained on over a million color images. We evaluate our algorithm using a “colorization Turing test”, asking human participants to choose between a generated and ground truth color image.
